Tired of having difficult answers to the most simple questions, - who are you; what do you do; - I wanted to 
create a visual response that would help me out.

Using mainly d3js, this portfolio landing-page organizes the facets of "what I do" into a more tangible graphic. 
Tying each variable to data means that each node of the interface is flexible enough to shrink and grow organically with me.
